# OPTCG-CardScraper
Run the index.js file, it will write all card data for the newly released One Piece TCG game into the card.json file and save all the images in the img folder.
For first time image saving, some of the images might be "half loaded in" or have some graphical bugs, you can run the code again and it should fix that problem.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
node index.js
```
